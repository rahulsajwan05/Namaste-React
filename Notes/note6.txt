Monolith and micro-services
    -- monolith - 


--useEffect() has two parameter -
    callback - as soon as the render cycle is completer means complete is render then it will call the callback fucntion 
        ex-  i use the useEffect in fucntional component (body) and whatevery the data or UI is present in that component
        that will render first then callback will execute.

        * so if you have to do something as soon as the rendering finiesh then use useEffect

-- instead of loader we use shimmer UI  
    load an fake page until we get data from API by shimmer UI

--why do we need state variable
    suppose we have a button login and on click or after login i want to change the name of that button from login to logout
    then even if we add event click handler then update the btnname variable still it wont update because DOM didnt detect
    any chnage. so useState comes into the picture when we chnage soemthing
    *it will re-render the whole header component if we have login in header *
