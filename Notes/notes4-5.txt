Props -- normal argument to function , passing a prop to a component means passing argument to function component
        ** use **
            when you pass some dynamic data to an component you pass through props

config driven UI --
    how the UI should look like using  data ( config ) and config comes from backend

-- React itself says dont use index as keys

--Two types of export and import 
    * Default export/import
        export Default <component name>
        import <component name> from <path>
    
    *Named export import
        export const <component name>
        import { <component name> } from <path>  
-- React is good at DOm operation so it is fast
--Hooks     
    normal js function which is given by react but that fucntion has some logic in behind (Normal js utility fucntion). which has their
    own specific use case
    *useState() - superpowerful state variable use to create state variable , why it is superfast beacue react constantly monitoring the variable   
        and when we update something on lcikc or any other event then it call the call variable which is set 
        then the dif algorithm will run find the difference between birtual DOM and the update the UI. becaue dif algorithm
        keeps the UI and data layer in sync
    *useEffect() -

--react use reaconxilition algorithm behind the scene ( react Fibre )

    Virtual DOm - Representation of actual DOm, it is an object Representation of DOm and react is fast because object
        difference in much faster as compared to HTML so we compare do object and then if they find any differnnce
        then the actual updated the DOM.  
    actual DOM - which we see in DOM

-- DIf algorithm find rthe difference between the virtual DOm and update virtual DOM
